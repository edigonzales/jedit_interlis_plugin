So let's get back to the auto closer. Please write it w/o ast with the following features and use cases for the CLASS element (at the moment). Following are the cases that should work: 

"CLASS foo ="
"CLASS (ABSTRACT) foo ="
"CLASS (EXTENDED) foo ="
"CLASS (FINAL) foo ="
"CLASS foo EXTENDS bar ="

The use case with the braces can be combined and mixed. The order of the properties inside the braces is not relevant.

"CLASS (ABSTRACT, EXTENDED) foo ="

All the words / elements can be on different lines and there can be multiple whitespaces between the words.

I will add rules for VIEW, TOPIC, STRUCTURE later. So please reflect this in your implementation. You can write even a small parses with some rules. 


---------


How could be a regex free solution look like? Also without the ast index of the mode. B/c this won't work since it's always out of sync with the buffer. E.g. how would you implement a tokenizer?


---------


The very same rules apply to "STRUCTURE".


---------


Can you please fix the indentation? If the Header starts with e.g. an indentation of 3 whitespaces the closing text should too.


---------


Ok, let's implement TOPIC. These are the cases:

"TOPIC foo ="
"TOPIC (ABSTRACT) foo ="
"TOPIC (FINAL) foo ="
"TOPIC foo EXTENDS bar ="

The properties in the braces can be combined and the order does not matter. Properties can be combined with EXTENDS:

"TOPIC (ABSTRACT) foo EXTENDS bar="

EXTENDED cannot be used.

A topic can also be something like a view. The syntax is:

"VIEW TOPIC foo =". 

But in this case there is "DEPENDS ON" following the "=" sign. So please add these two strings on a new line, like:

"
VIEW TOPIC foo =
DEPENDS ON
END foo;
"


---------



Ok, this works so far very nicelly. I noticed that I really would like to add a empty line betwenn the header and the end, like:

"
CLASS foo =

END foo;
"

And please put the cursor on this line.


--------


Does not work. The cursor is just after "=". But it should be on the new line.


--------


Much better. Please adjust the indentation of the cursor. Use the same as for the header and the end.


--------


Ok, thanks. For "VIEW TOPIC" the cursor should be just on whitespace after "DEPENDS ON"


--------


Now let's implement MODEL. You will have to insert more text. Also between the model name the "=". There is actually one simple rule:

"MODEL foo ="

But them you will have to insert a lot of text. The result should look like this:

"
/** !!------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * !! Version    | wer | Ã„nderung
 * !!------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * !! 2025-08-10 | abr  | Initalversion
 * !!==============================================================================
 */
!!@ technicalContact=mailto:acme@example.com
!!@ furtherInformation=https://example.com/path/to/information
!!@ title="a title"
!!@ shortDescription="a short description"
MODEL foo (de)
AT "https://example.com"
VERSION "2025-08-10"  =

END foo;
"

Please use the current date for the dates ("2025-08-10"). Put the cursor on the empty line before END (just like with CLASS).


---------


Did you miss the empty (to be implemented) methods? And I also get his error: Local variable removeLen is required to be final or effectively final based on its usage


---------


Please show me the full code / full class with all your fixes.



--------

Some very small adjustments: Please indent AT and VERSION with two whitespaces and put the "=" on a new line.


--------


Ok. This is great. Now I want to implement the following: Some models import other models, e.g. GeometryCHLV95_V1. Now if a person types "GeometryCHLV95_V1." (see the trailing dot) jedit should suggest the elements of this model. And for convience. The names of the importet models should also be suggested. At the moment there are only the keywords in a list (KEYWORDS = List.of()) that is used for suggestions in the InterlisSideKickParser class. You probably want to add some of the logic in the TdCache class. Some methods that are usefull:

"Model[] models = td.getModelsFromLastFile();": gets all models from the .ili file.
"Model[] importedModels = model.getImporting();": gets all the models that a model imports
